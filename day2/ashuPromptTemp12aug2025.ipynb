            "Lyra the unicorn lived in the Moonlit Meadow, where the grass smelled faintly of rain and the stars seemed to sigh themselves to sleep each night. Her mane shimmered with pale silver and her horn glowed like a tiny lantern, guiding night creatures home to their cozy burrows. Lyra loved the hush of late hours, when everything paused to listen to the soft world breathe.\n",
            "\n",
            "One night, Lyra found a small cottage at the edge of the meadow. A girl named Mina pressed her face to the window, eyes wide with worry, counting the thunder-broken hours. The storm had passed, but Mina’s thoughts kept rattling like loose pebbles in a stream. She tugged her blanket closer and wished for a quiet dream to drift into.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lyra stepped softly onto the dew-kissed lawn and spoke in a voice like a gentle wind. “Hello, Mina. I brought a little night-light, if you’d like to share it.” Her horn woke with a warm glow, casting a soft circle of light that turned the room from a jumble of sounds into a gentle hush.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mina watched in wonder as tiny sparkles unfurled from Lyra’s horn, weaving themselves into a delicate tapestry of light. The light pressed against the ceiling and painted it with stars, the way the sky looks just before morning. “Lie still,” Lyra whispered, “and listen to the night’s own lullaby.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The unicorn sang without words, a melody made of crickets’ sighs, the rustle of leaves, and the distant wind tracing a lullaby through the branches. The Dreamweave she spun glowed faintly, threading pictures in the air: a boat gliding on a lake of moonlight, a bell in a cozy tower, a kettle softly singing on a stove. Mina’s breathing slowed, and her shoulders dropped from the tense curve of awake.\n",
            "\n",
            "Slowly, the fear that had lived in Mina's chest began to melt away into warmth and safety. The storm’s memory faded behind the new pictures, and the room grew quiet as a Sunday afternoon. Mina blinked, then smiled a little, tired now, as if her dreams had started to read themselves aloud.\n",
            "\n",
            "When at last Mina's eyes fluttered closed, Lyra’s light dimmed to a gentle glow. “Sweet dreams,” she whispered, “until morning paints the world again.” She stepped back into the meadow’s soft glow and left behind a single, shining hoofprint on the windowpane—a promise that the night would always hold a soft place for a tired heart.\n",
            "\n",
            "And from that night on, whenever Mina found it hard to sleep, she remembered Lyra’s light and the Dreamweave of stars, and she drifted into dreams with a quiet, brave smile.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you’d like, I can adjust the length or change the setting for a different bedtime mood.\n"
